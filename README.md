TOP Recipe Project

In this project I will apply the basic HTML knowledge I have learned in the Foundations course on TOP. I should show my ability to set-up a boilerplate and how I can use most basic HTML tags: <title>, <body>, <h> tags, <em>, <strong>, <a>, and <img>. I should also demonstrate knowledge and understanding of attributes for elements as well.
